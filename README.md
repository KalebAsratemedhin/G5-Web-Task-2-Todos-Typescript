# G5-Web-Task-2-Todos-Typescript

This is a simple todos web app done using html, css and typescript. Users can add todos, edit, set the status as completed or not or delete them. It stores the todos in memory so if the page is refreshed, they will be lost.

In this project I have used typescript to harness its static type checking capability. The script was then compiled to javascript inorder for browsers to run it.

# How to run 
```
  git clone https://github.com/KalebAsratemedhin/G5-Web-Task-2-Todos-Typescript.git
  cd G5-Web-Task-2-Todos-Typescript
```
You can run the app using liveserver or by opening the index.html file with a browser.
